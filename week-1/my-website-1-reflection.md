## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a repository on GitHub is simple. You go to github.com and in the top right corner by your profile icon is a plus sign. Click that and in the dropdown select New Repository. Give it a name, something unique, write a description about what this repository is if you want, select if you want it to be public or private and select which license you would like to include. That is all you need to do and this will create a repository for you. To clone a repository means to copy in and put it in a new location. You would most likely want to clone your repository to your local machine so you can work on it. To do that go to the repository on your GitHub account. On the right side there is a URL for that repository. Copy the link then go to your Terminal on your local machine and navigate to the folder where you would like to put the repository. Once you are there type "git clone" and then paste the URL there.

Open source means that anyone can download and look at the source code for a project. It is available and free for anyone to copy, modify and use in other projects. Software like Adobe Photoshop can be interpretted by a computer but the source code is hidden and protected. Open source is the opposite.

Personally, I tihnk open source is an amazing concept. I believe transparency and collaboration spurs innovation so the more open source projects out there the better. It doesn't make me nervous or protective however I haven't studied the topic of open source that much so I am sure there is a programmer out there that could enlighten me to the downsides of open source. But companies like Automattic are able to monetize a product and create an open source application WordPress which seems like the best of both worlds. Keeping software open source while maintaining a revenue stream.

Using a license does seem important I guess. I don't understand why we would use it for our reflection assignment except for one reason. If someone wanted to use our assignment in another application, say put it on their blog to talk about Dev Bootcamp, they wouldn't have to try and get in touch with me before they did it. They could just look at the MIT license. See it's okay and use it. But in general, they are important because they designate in what way a project can be used. If they want to make it open source there are a bunch of different open source licenses with different terms.

I had no real aha moments, although this really helped me solidify concepts from the last challenge. I could go through the whole process of creating a repository, cloning it, creating a new branch to work on, pushing it then creating a pull request and merging. I was a little unsure before but now I think I really get it and the practice helps. If there was one aha moment it would be with licenses, I didn't really get them before or what they really meant and now I do.
