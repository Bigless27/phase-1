1. What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a guide to the layout of your website. They can range from very basic to high definition wireframes which can include a lot of the content you are going to use on your page.
2. What are the benefits of wireframing.
The benefits of using a wireframe are that you can really plan out how the information is going to be laid out on your page so it makes it easier to code the HTML and CSS of your website later.
3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did enjoy wireframing my site. At the beginning I kind of just sat there because it is a little daunting to begin, but it's going to make the rest of the development phase very easy because now I have this guide to work off of and it just comes down to implementation. I have a nice neat plan to work from. It also helped me visualize the site before starting to write the code and I know where elements will go and how I am going to link to all the other pages.
4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I reworked my site map a lot and I changed the idea for the wireframe of my blog index after creating the wireframe of my personal website. I decided to have the header and footer be consistent across these pages. I did work through a few different sketches before using the online tool Gliffy to create the wireframe. I reorganized the navigation bar and navigation links, and simplified the index page so it is simpler and a little more minimalist.
5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The first question I had was which wireframing tool to use. I used the Mashable article to look through some options and ultimately landed on Gliffy because it was super easy to start using and you could easily create an account. I also needed some inspiration so a question I asked was what really nice personal websites look like. I found an article about 35 Cool Personal Websites and found a few I liked to base my off of.
6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed the actual wireframing process and using my site map to create a wireframe and website design that made sense. I found it hard to initial choose what I wanted the design to look like. It's hard to create a solution that is both effective and looks clean and professional. I hav a feeling I will be making changes to the design moving forward.
