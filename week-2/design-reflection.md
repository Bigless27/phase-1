1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The first phase of web design is information gathering. This is where you figure out the purpose, goals, target audience and content for your site so you are ready for step 2, which is planning. Here you create a site map and decide what technologies you are going to use for your site. The third step is design, where you use the info you gathered and your site map to decide what design you want for your site. You would wireframe the site to get a feel for how it would work, decide your color scheme and logos you will use. In phase 6 you actually do the development. You create your homepage first, then a shell page for all your internal pages. This shell page has the navigational structure for the whole site so you have a consistent feel. Phase 5 is the testing and delivery phase which is testing functionality so you know how it will work and fix all compatibilty issues. Finally, phase 6 is maintenance. You will need to upkeep your site, adding new content and new technologies as they become available.

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary goal is to be a professional website for myself. It will have information about me, my education and my working career. It will also have a link to projects I'm working on, contact information and also links to all of my social media sites. Finally, I would like to include recommendations so visitors will get a feel for my personality and get an introduciton to things I like.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience will be interested in technology, social media and web design. Since it is my professional website, I am hoping the target audience will be individuals from the tech industry with experience. Because of that, I am hoping to show my personality with my recommendations, my expertise with the site layout, about me as well as the examples of projects I've worked on. Finally I'll give them a way to contact me and see my other endeavors with links to my social media accounts and a link for email.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action the user should take is to contact me since it is my professional website. The other primary action will be looking at my portfolio because this will give visitors an introduction to my work and hopefully a reason to contact me.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
One of the most important things about design and user experience is that it should be designed with the user in mind. There are now so many ways to access the internet, there are growing number of users online that now it's more important than ever to design a site for the potential audience. User experience is not one size fits all and it can't be assessed with traditional metrics. It is specific to every individual so you need to really think about your target audience.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is designing a site for the user. It addresses how a  user feels when interfacing with a system. It is so important because it is based on the user and as I said above, there are more and more users online and user experience will influence who and how many visitors come to your site.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found my interaction with git and getting the site map online the most tedious part. I did my first backup wrong so I kept getting an error when trying to do my pull requests. It took a while to figure out what was going on and get rid of the errors so I could commit correctly.
