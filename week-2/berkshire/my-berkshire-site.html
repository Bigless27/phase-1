<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  It was a little intimidating at first, but once you get started it becomes more natural and a little easier. You start remembering the HTML tags you can use and with a partner it becomes even easier because you have 2 people working on the problem. Sometimes it was hard to figure out what the best practice would be so it will be as simple as possible later when adding CSS.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  It wasn't too hard to research and use semantic HTML5 elements. When there was an issue or we needed a specific tag for something, we would look it up at w3 schools or Google to figure out what we needed to use. Other than that, the tags we used were pretty generic HTML elements, like the <p> tag or the <a> tag.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  I believe we did okay sticking to the best practices. Sometimes it's hard to keep the indentation spaced correctly so I had to clean it up at the end to make sure it was correct. Also, at points we had used formatting tags that we later had to go and take out, like the <br> tag and the <strong> tag for bold. We can use CSS later to add those spaces and formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

  The good part of HTML is definitely how simple it is. Without formatting, it is easy to focus on how you want to break up the content, link to other pages and how you want to structure your webpage. This means, though, that a lot of the work will happen in CSS, which will take a little longer than if you did some of it with HTML. Also, sometimes it was hard to remember that you want to have no styling. We added a <strong> tag but took it out later because we realized it was formatting that we didn't actually need yet.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  I don't have any tricks for remembering how to write HTML yet. I remember it through repetition and doing things over and over again.
